## Module 4, Lesson 4.2 â€“ AWS & Large Datasets

### Key Concepts

**Large Datasets (The 3 Vs)**
- **Volume**: Massive amounts of data (terabytes or petabytes).
- **Velocity**: Data arrives quickly (e.g., real-time stock prices).
- **Variety**: Comes in different formats (tables, text, logs, etc.).

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
- **Definition**: Cloud platform providing computing power, storage, and database services.
- **Why it's used**:
  - Flexible and scalable: Rent thousands of virtual computers instantly.
  - Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use.
- **Your role**: End-user, not a cloud engineer. Know how to:
  - Connect to cloud-based databases with SQL.
  - Check service status and logs via the AWS Console.

**Understanding Checkpoints**
1. **Why AWS?**
   - Scalable & cost-efficient vs owning physical servers.
2. **Does exposure mean building cloud networks?**
   - No. It means using cloud services comfortably, connecting to data, running queries, and monitoring resources.

## Module 5, Lesson 5.1 â€“ The Interview: Connecting the Dots

### Key Concept
- Interviews for hybrid roles = **connect technical skills to business impact**.
- Role = "bridge the gap between technical testing and business logic."

### The Magic Formula for Answers
1. **Acknowledge the Technical Task** â€“ Show understanding of testing actions.
2. **Connect to Business Impact** â€“ Explain why it matters to the company or client.
3. **Mention Tools** â€“ SQL, Python, or other relevant tools.

### Example: Testing a New Risk Model

**Weak Answer**
- "I would write some test cases to check the outputs."

**Strong Answer (Magic Formula Applied)**
1. **Technical Task & Tools**:
   - Perform acceptance testing on the model.
   - Create a test portfolio with risky vs stable stocks.
   - Use SQL to pull stock data and Python to verify calculations.
2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Check model with stocks having no trading history or during market flash crashes.
3. **Business Impact**:
   - A model that fails under stress is untrustworthy for asset management.

### Practice Question

**Question:**
*"Imagine you find a bug where monthly returns on the dashboard are off by 0.05%. How would you investigate and report it?"*

**Refined Answer (Magic Formula)**
1. **Technical Task & Tools**
   - Hypothesize causes: calculation logic or data issue.
   - Use SQL to extract holdings and price data.
   - Run Python script to independently calculate returns.
   - Compare script output to platform results; isolate discrepancies.
2. **Business Impact**
   - Accuracy is critical; even small errors undermine client trust and reporting.
3. **Reporting**
   - File detailed bug report with independent calculation, SQL queries, sample data, and financial impact.

### Key Takeaways
- Be **structured and methodical**.
- Demonstrate **tool proficiency** (SQL, Python).
- Show **business understanding** â€“ you're not just a tester, you safeguard financial integrity.
